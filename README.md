<h2> INTRODUCTION </h2>
<p>The Government Rural Employment Scheme is a comprehensive program aimed at promoting the welfare of individuals by offering them regular employment opportunities and guaranteed wages on a daily basis throughout the duration of specific projects they are engaged in. The primary objective of this scheme is to establish a safety net for impoverished rural communities while simultaneously fostering sustainable livelihoods by developing essential assets and infrastructure in rural areas.</p>
