<h2> INTRODUCTION </h2>
<p>The Government Rural Employment Scheme is a comprehensive program aimed at promoting the welfare of individuals by offering them regular employment opportunities and guaranteed wages on a daily basis throughout the duration of specific projects they are engaged in. The primary objective of this scheme is to establish a safety net for impoverished rural communities while simultaneously fostering sustainable livelihoods by developing essential assets and infrastructure in rural areas.</p>

<h1>Class Design</h1>
The application uses POJO classes to represent the entities in the system. The classes include BlockDevelopmentOfficer, GramPanchayatMember, User, CurrentUserSession etc. The service layer is designed using interfaces, such as BDOService and GMPService, to provide separation between the business logic and the controller layer.
